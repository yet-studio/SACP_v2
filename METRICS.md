# Quality Metrics & Evolution Tracking

## 0. [CRITICAL] Strategy Validation
Every change MUST have:
```yaml
strategy:
  documentation:
    status: REQUIRED
    location: "docs/strategy/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md"
    template: |
      # Strategy Document
      ## 1. Purpose
      - What problem are we solving?
      - Why is this important?
      
      ## 2. Approach
      - How will we solve it?
      - What alternatives were considered?
      
      ## 3. Impact Analysis
      - Quality impact
      - Security implications
      - Performance considerations
      
      ## 4. Success Criteria
      - Specific metrics
      - Validation points
      - Expected outcomes
  
  validation:
    status: REQUIRED
    steps:
      - Document strategy
      - Get explicit approval
      - Define metrics
      - THEN proceed
    
    checklist:
      - [ ] Strategy documented
      - [ ] Approach validated
