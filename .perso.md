# SACP - Personal Development Notes & Strategy

## Professional Development Principles
### Core Values
- Enterprise-grade quality MANDATORY
- Deep analysis before ANY action
- Strict adherence to development procedures
- Zero-compromise on security and testing

### Analysis Requirements
BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGE:
1. Full Context Analysis
   - Current system state
   - Architectural impact
   - Security implications
   - Test coverage impact
   - Performance considerations

2. Documentation Review
   - ROADMAP.md alignment
   - NOTES.md completeness
   - Technical specifications
   - Security requirements

3. Risk Assessment
   - Technical debt potential
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Breaking changes
   - Performance impact

## Development Procedure (STRICT)
### 1. Pre-Development Phase
- [ ] Complete context analysis
- [ ] Architecture review
- [ ] Security impact assessment
- [ ] Test strategy definition
- [ ] Documentation plan
- [ ] Get explicit approval

### 2. Test Development Phase
- [ ] Write integration tests
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Write security tests
- [ ] Write performance tests
- [ ] Review test coverage
- [ ] Validate test quality

### 3. Implementation Phase
- [ ] Follow TDD strictly
- [ ] Regular test execution
- [ ] Code review checklist
- [ ] Security validation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Documentation updates

### 4. Validation Phase
- [ ] Full test suite execution
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Performance validation
- [ ] Documentation review
- [ ] Code quality checks
- [ ] Peer review

## Current Project State (2025-02-01)
### Critical Analysis
✅ Strong Foundation:
- Enterprise architecture
- Security framework
- Test infrastructure
- Documentation standards

⚠️ Strategic Gaps:
- Real AI integration missing
- Incomplete test coverage
- Architecture/implementation imbalance

### Immediate Focus: OpenAI Integration
#### 1. Analysis Requirements
- [ ] OpenAI API documentation review
- [ ] Security implications study
- [ ] Performance requirements
- [ ] Integration test strategy
- [ ] Error handling approach

#### 2. Implementation Steps
Each step requires:
1. Full analysis documentation
2. Complete test suite
3. Security validation
4. Performance benchmarks
5. Documentation updates
6. Code review
7. Integration validation

## Professional Standards Checklist
### Every Code Change Must:
1. Have prior analysis
2. Follow TDD strictly
3. Include all test types:
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Security tests
   - Performance tests
   - Edge case tests

4. Pass quality gates:
   - 100% test coverage
   - Security validation
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Style compliance
   - Documentation standards

5. Include documentation:
   - Technical specifications
   - API documentation
   - Security considerations
   - Usage examples
   - Update ROADMAP.md/NOTES.md

## Quality Assurance Protocol
### Code Review Standards
- Architecture consistency
- Security compliance
- Test completeness
- Performance impact
- Documentation quality
- Error handling
- Edge cases covered

### Security Requirements

- Audit logging
- Rate limiting
- Error handling

### Performance Standards
- Response time limits
- Resource usage bounds
- Scalability requirements
- Monitoring points
- Optimization targets

## Development Commands
```bash
# Pre-commit checks
pylint src/
black src/
mypy src/

# Test suite
pytest tests/ -v
pytest --cov=src tests/
pytest --cov-report html tests/

# Security checks
bandit -r src/
safety check

# Performance tests
python -m pytest tests/performance/
```

## Success Criteria (Strict)
1. Complete Analysis
   - Full context documented
   - All impacts assessed
   - Risks identified
   - Mitigation strategies defined

2. Perfect Test Coverage
   - All test types implemented
   - Edge cases covered
   - Security validated
   - Performance verified

3. Professional Implementation
   - Clean architecture
   - Security-first
   - Performance-optimized
   - Fully documented

4. Quality Validation
   - All tests passing
   - Security approved
   - Performance validated
   - Documentation complete

Remember: Quality and professionalism are non-negotiable. Every step must be thoroughly analyzed, properly tested, and professionally implemented.
