# Strategy Document: VALIDATION.md Structure

## 1. Purpose
- Establish a robust and explicit validation system
- Ensure quality at every stage of development
- Provide clear and actionable checkpoints
- Ensure traceability of validations

## 2. Approach
### File Structure
```yaml
validation:
  principles:
    - Documentation before action
    - Tests before code
    - Non-negotiable quality
    - Security by default
  
  checkpoints:
    strategy:
      required: true
      template: docs/strategy/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md
      points:
        - Purpose documented
        - Approach validated
        - Impact analyzed
        - Success criteria defined
    
    code:
      required: true
      points:
        - Tests written
        - Standards respected
        - Security verified
        - Performance evaluated
    
    documentation:
      required: true
      points:
        - API documented
        - Examples provided
        - Changes noted
        - Impacts described

  process:
    1. Strategy validation
    2. Technical validation
    3. Quality validation
    4. Security validation
    5. Final validation
```

## 3. Impact Analysis
### Quality
- Standardized validation documentation
- Explicit checkpoints
- Reproducible process
- Measurable quality

### Security

- Security checkpoints
- Traceability of validations
- Auditing possible

### Performance
- Clear validation process
- Ready-to-use templates
- Rapid validation
- No time wasted

## 4. Success Criteria
- [ ] Clear and logical structure
- [ ] Explicit validation points
- [ ] Practical templates
- [ ] Actionable process
